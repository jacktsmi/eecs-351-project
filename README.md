# Musical Mood Classifier
Code for the class project in EECS 351 (Digital Signal Processing). Group members include Jack Smith, Jorge Alvarez, and Saaketh Medepalli.

# Dependencies  
This project has only been tested with the following:  
* NumPy Version 1.19.5   
* Savify Version 2.3.4
* FFmpeg Version 4.2.4
* Python 3.8.5

# Instructions for Testing (EECS 351 Preliminary)
We used Visual Studio Code for testing. Open featurizer_tests.py and run entire file. If in Visual Studio Code, then right click in the file and select "Run Current File in Interactive Window." This provides plots for the three features we have coded so far, and for one calm song and one hype song.
